# About Me

## Objectives
My main goal at this point in my life is to gain more professional experience with my programming
skills. I have gained some insight in professional environments when working in my Truckxi internship
and to some degree my Make School application (which are explained in detail below), but I want to
be able to continually add to my experience in order to better understand what kinds of programming
I'm more interested in. 

I still have no plans on specializing in any area at the moment so I am hoping to fit myself in as
many positions as possible in order to decide what path I want to go down before I graduate from
college.

## Skills
I learned Python throughout all three quarters during my freshman year at UC Irvine and also used
this language when helping the back-end during my internship at Truckxi. I learned and relearned
the basics as well during my senior year of high school and through summer sessions at UC 
Berkeley. This is the language I am currently the most confident in.

I have only used Swift when coding my mobile application during the Make School Summer Program a couple
of years ago. I picked up on this language the quickest out of the four languages I know at the moment,
but I have also spent the least amount of time using this language. Despite the lack of time, however,
I do feel fairly confident with my abilities programming with Swift.

I learned the basics of Javascript during my internship at Truckxi. I am confident that I will be able
to learn this language on a deeper level if required.

Java is the first language I learned during my junior year of high school. As with Javascript, I am
confident that I can learn this language on a deeper level if required.

In terms of frameworks, I have worked with Django, React, and Redux throughout my Truckxi internship.
I am more familiar with React and Redux than Django, and I used Django for back-end work and React/Redux
for front-end work.

This Fall Quarter I am taking a class that will be teaching me C++, so I will have this language
at my disposal as well by the time summer hits.

## Experience (outside school)
### *Truckxi Internship*
I took on quite a few roles throughout my time at Truckxi. I generally switched between a video editor,
a bug tester, a bug fixer, and also generally ghosted various programmers.

Truckxi had quite a few projects going on, but the main project that I interacted with helped with was
a Supply Chain Management service that helped warehouses better keep track of shipments and goods they
needed or have. The service needed to be able to connect various databases and servers together in order
to stay up-to-date with the warehouse and its employees. Working on the SCM helped me develop some skills
in regards to working with servers as well as become more familiar with the division of programming
jobs between my co-workers. 

In regards to programming, I mainly helped with making sure Purchase Orders and Sales Orders successfully
rendered properly and updated the inventory. This involved making sure that the user can filter through
the items they are trying to find and making sure that cancelling orders or updating orders will correctly
update the server and thus the database.

I spent most of my programming time helping to fix bugs in the back-end and front-end. While working on
the back-end, I used the Django framework to code with Python. For the front-end I used a combination of
React and Redux to code with Javascript.
