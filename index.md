# About Me

## Objectives
I am currently a Junior at UC Irvine majoring in Computer Science and specializing in Algorithms. My current cumulative GPA is 3.70.

My main goal at the moment is to gain more professional experience with my programming
skills and hopefully discover an internship that will both peak my interest in the field and
extend into a full-time job offer after I graduate from UCI. I have gained some insight
in professional environments when working in my Truckxi and JD internships
and to some degree my Make School application (which are explained in detail below), but I want to
be able to continually add to my experience in order to better understand what kinds of programming
I'm more interested in. 

I still have no plans on specializing in any area at the moment so I am hoping to fit myself in as
many positions as possible in order to decide what path I want to go down before I graduate from
college.

## Skills
*Python* -I learned Python throughout all three quarters during my freshman year at UC Irvine and also used
this language when helping the back-end during my internship at Truckxi. I learned and relearned
the basics as well during my senior year of high school and through summer sessions at UC 
Berkeley. This is the language I am currently the most confident in.

*Swift* -I have used Swift when coding my mobile application during the Make School Summer Program a couple
of years ago. I picked up on this language the quickest out of the four languages I know at the moment,
but I have not spent as much time using this language as with others. Despite the lack of time, however,
I do feel fairly confident with my abilities programming with Swift and am looking forward to new opportunities
to practice.

*Javascript* -I learned the basics of Javascript during my internship at Truckxi. I am confident that I will be able
to learn this language on a deeper level if required.

*Bootstrap* -I learned the basics of Bootstrap during my Informatics 133 class at UCI, which is generally about Computer-User Interaction.

*Java* -Java is the first language I learned during my junior year of high school. As with Javascript, I am
confident that I can learn this language on a deeper level if required.

*Frameworks* -In terms of frameworks, I have worked with Django, React, and Redux throughout my Truckxi internship.
I am more familiar with React and Redux than Django, and I used Django for back-end work and React/Redux
for front-end work.

*C++* -I took taking a class that taught the fundamentals of C++, so I have a proficient understanding of the language.

*Linux* -Quite a few of my classes use linux and vm's, so my overall knowledge surrounding the topic is pretty solid.

## Experience (outside school)
### *JD.com Internship (June-September, 2018)*
JD.com is China's largest online retailer and its biggest overall retailer. I worked at a US branch of the company in 
Mountain View, CA. I was an intern in the AI NLP branch and worked in the backend for this project.

My main goal as an AI NLP intern was to get their English deep parsing system's accuracy to rise from ~30% to ~70% over 
the course of the summer. In this internship, I was able to have first-hand experience in seeing how the entire parsing
system worked, including the input, tokenization, parsing, their server-test system, to the end product. Most of the backend
was all coded in Python, but I also needed to learn and utilize their own custom language when modifying or creating rules to 
grammatically structure the English sentences. 

My main job as intern was to go through a cycle of rule modification/creation, unit tests, and unit regression tests, as well 
as updating and maintaining the large English lexicons we had in the database. I was occasionally assigned to add new features
to the English parsing system such as ways to incorporate compound words and a stemming feature to catch words that may have
been missing from the lexicon in our database.

Overall, this project allowed me to gain more experience in picking up new concepts faster in terms of learning their custom 
language as well as manipulating large databases in the form of the English lexicons. I was also able to understand how the 
entirety of a system works from input to output for English deep parsing. By the end of the internship, I was able to raise the
accuracy to pass the 70% expectation and make the system around 85% accurate.

### *Truckxi Internship (June-August, 2017)*
I took on quite a few roles throughout my time at Truckxi. I switched between being a video editor,
a bug tester, a bug fixer, and also generally ghosted various programmers.

Truckxi had quite a few projects going on, but the main project that I interacted with helped with was
a Supply Chain Management service that helped warehouses better keep track of shipments and goods they
needed or have. The service needed to be able to connect various databases and servers together in order
to stay up-to-date with the warehouse and its employees. Working on the SCM helped me develop some skills
in regards to working with servers as well as become more familiar with the division of programming
jobs between my co-workers. 

In regards to programming, I mainly helped with making sure Purchase Orders and Sales Orders successfully
rendered properly and updated the inventory. This involved making sure that the user can filter through
the items they are trying to find and making sure that cancelling orders or updating orders will correctly
update the server and thus the database.

I spent most of my programming time helping to fix bugs in the back-end and front-end. While working on
the back-end, I used the Django framework to code with Python. For the front-end I used a combination of
React and Redux to code with Javascript. 

### *Make School Summer Program (July-August, 2016)*
During the eight week summer program of Make School, I, along with around twenty others in my category, worked on
creating a mobile app and publishing it before the program ended. In my case, I created an game application called
Futility. Futility is essentially an arcade survival-style game where the user tries to score as many points as possible.
The premise of the game revolves around trying to match colors between different objects in order to keep a ball
from reaching the floor. For more detail, the link to the app is here --> <https://itunes.apple.com/za/app/futility/id1024745637?mt=8>

I used both SpriteBuilder and Swift to create this application. SpriteBuilder helped me import graphics and easily
create the visual placements of all my resources. I used Swift to code in the logic and details of the objects. Some technical
challenges I met were focused on making the physics of the game fluid and natural. 

Throughout the course of this program, I collaborated with my coding neighbors in a variety of ways. For the most part, we helped
each other bug-test each other's games and criticized each others' UX designs to make the mobile app feel simplistic and easy-to-use.
We also initially worked together to accumulate and combine ideas so all of us would be able to choose a concept we saw potential in.

### *Hackathons (2015-2016)* 
I went to a variety of hackathons throughout highschool that gave me my first feel of working in a group and coding outside of school.
During these hackathons I took on various roles, which include being a coordinator, coder, graphics designer, and tester. We created 
different types of games such as a side-scrolling survivor game or a simplistic arcade survival-esque game somewhat reminiscent of 
Futility.
