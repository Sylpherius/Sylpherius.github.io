# About Me

## Objectives
I am a Sophomore at UC Irvine majoring in Computer Science. My current cumulative GPA is 3.86, and my GPA for Computer Science-related classes is 4.0.

My main goal at this point in my life is to gain more professional experience with my programming
skills. I have gained some insight in professional environments when working in my Truckxi internship
and to some degree my Make School application (which are explained in detail below), but I want to
be able to continually add to my experience in order to better understand what kinds of programming
I'm more interested in. 

I still have no plans on specializing in any area at the moment so I am hoping to fit myself in as
many positions as possible in order to decide what path I want to go down before I graduate from
college.

## Skills
*Python* -I learned Python throughout all three quarters during my freshman year at UC Irvine and also used
this language when helping the back-end during my internship at Truckxi. I learned and relearned
the basics as well during my senior year of high school and through summer sessions at UC 
Berkeley. This is the language I am currently the most confident in.

*Swift* -I have used Swift when coding my mobile application during the Make School Summer Program a couple
of years ago. I picked up on this language the quickest out of the four languages I know at the moment,
but I have not spent as much time using this language as with others. Despite the lack of time, however,
I do feel fairly confident with my abilities programming with Swift and am looking forward to new opportunities
to practice.

*Javascript* -I learned the basics of Javascript during my internship at Truckxi. I am confident that I will be able
to learn this language on a deeper level if required.

*Java* -Java is the first language I learned during my junior year of high school. As with Javascript, I am
confident that I can learn this language on a deeper level if required.

*Frameworks* -In terms of frameworks, I have worked with Django, React, and Redux throughout my Truckxi internship.
I am more familiar with React and Redux than Django, and I used Django for back-end work and React/Redux
for front-end work.

*C++* -This Fall Quarter I am taking a class that will be teaching me C++, so I will have this language
at my disposal as well by the time summer hits.

## Experience (outside school)
### *Truckxi Internship (June-August, 2017)*
I took on quite a few roles throughout my time at Truckxi. I switched between being a video editor,
a bug tester, a bug fixer, and also generally ghosted various programmers.

Truckxi had quite a few projects going on, but the main project that I interacted with helped with was
a Supply Chain Management service that helped warehouses better keep track of shipments and goods they
needed or have. The service needed to be able to connect various databases and servers together in order
to stay up-to-date with the warehouse and its employees. Working on the SCM helped me develop some skills
in regards to working with servers as well as become more familiar with the division of programming
jobs between my co-workers. 

In regards to programming, I mainly helped with making sure Purchase Orders and Sales Orders successfully
rendered properly and updated the inventory. This involved making sure that the user can filter through
the items they are trying to find and making sure that cancelling orders or updating orders will correctly
update the server and thus the database.

I spent most of my programming time helping to fix bugs in the back-end and front-end. While working on
the back-end, I used the Django framework to code with Python. For the front-end I used a combination of
React and Redux to code with Javascript. 

### *Make School Summer Program (July-August, 2016)*
During the eight week summer program of Make School, I, along with around twenty others in my category, worked on
creating a mobile app and publishing it before the program ended. In my case, I created an game application called
Futility. Futility is essentially an arcade survival-style game where the user tries to score as many points as possible.
The premise of the game revolves around trying to match colors between different objects in order to keep a ball
from reaching the floor. For more detail, the link to the app is here --> <https://itunes.apple.com/za/app/futility/id1024745637?mt=8>

I used both SpriteBuilder and Swift to create this application. SpriteBuilder helped me import graphics and easily
create the visual placements of all my resources. I used Swift to code in the logic and details of the objects. Some technical
challenges I met were focused on making the physics of the game fluid and natural. 

Throughout the course of this program, I collaborated with my coding neighbors in a variety of ways. For the most part, we helped
each other bug-test each other's games and criticized each others' UX designs to make the mobile app feel simplistic and easy-to-use.
We also initially worked together to accumulate and combine ideas so all of us would be able to choose a concept we saw potential in.

### *Hackathons (2015-2016)* 
I went to a variety of hackathons throughout highschool that gave me my first feel of working in a group and coding outside of school.
During these hackathons I took on various roles, which include being a coordinator, coder, graphics designer, and tester. We created 
different types of games such as a side-scrolling survivor game or a simplistic arcade survival-esque game somewhat reminiscent of 
Futility. 

## Classes Taken and Will Take
* **Introduction to Programming** taught me the fundamentals of Python.
* **Programming with Software Libraries** ranged from topics such as server connections to utilizing outside resources and libraries with python.
* **Intermediate Programming** focused more on the specific details of Python, such as overloading functions and debugging code.
* **Introduction to Digital Systems** taught more computer engineering-related subjects such as logic gates.
* **Programming in C/C++** taught basic and intermediate knowledge of C++
* **Introduction to Data Management** taught the fundamental of SQL
* **Introduction to Software Engineering** taught me the basics of software engineering as a whole.
* I will complete the class of **Programming in Java** which will give me deeper insight in the language.
* I will complete the class of **Data Structure Implementation and Analysis** which goes more in depth about data structures in C++.

The classes I'm planning to take are classes that will be taken before next summer.

[//]: ## Hobbies
[//]: I love playing cards and video games during my spare time. Occasionally, I do enjoy drawing as well or playing the piano when
[//]: one is available to me. Skiing and swimming are seasonal things I do when the opportunity is presented, and I enjoy playing ping 
[//]: pong as well if a table and friends are available to play.
