# About Me

## Objectives
My main goal at this point in my life is to gain more professional experience with my programming
skills. I have gained some insight in professional environments when working in my Truckxi internship
and to some degree my Make School application (which are explained in detail below), but I want to
be able to continually add to my experience in order to better understand what kinds of programming
I'm more interested in. 

I still have no plans on specializing in any area at the moment so I am hoping to fit myself in as
many positions as possible in order to decide what path I want to go down before I graduate from
college.

## Skills
I learned Python throughout all three quarters during my freshman year at UC Irvine and also used
this language when helping the back-end during my internship at Truckxi. I learned and relearned
the basics as well during my senior year of high school and through summer sessions at UC 
Berkeley. This is the language I am currently the most confident in.

I have only used Swift when coding my mobile application during the Make School Summer Program a couple
of years ago. I picked up on this language the quickest out of the four languages I know at the moment,
but I have also spent the least amount of time using this language. Despite the lack of time, however,
I do feel fairly confident with my abilities programming with Swift.

I learned the basics of Javascript during my internship at Truckxi. I am confident that I will be able
to learn this language on a deeper level if required.

Java is the first language I learned during my junior year of high school. As with Javascript, I am
confident that I can learn this language on a deeper level if required.

This Fall Quarter I am taking a class that will be teaching me C++, so I will have this language
at my disposal as well by the time summer hits.
